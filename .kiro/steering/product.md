# Product Overview

## Miner Evolution - Genetic Algorithm Simulation

A browser-based simulation of cooperative agents using genetic algorithms and neural networks. Agents learn to mine stones and deliver them to a central base through evolutionary optimization.

### Core Concept

- Agents evolve behaviors through natural selection
- Neural networks control agent decision-making
- Genetic algorithms optimize population fitness over generations
- Real-time visualization of agent behavior and evolution progress

### Key Features

- **Evolutionary Learning**: Population evolves through elite preservation, crossover, and mutation
- **Neural Network Control**: Each agent has a feedforward network (20 inputs → 8 hidden → 3 outputs)
- **Sensor System**: 5 configurable sensors detect stones, obstacles, and base location
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Agents learn to seek stones, mine them, and return to base
- **Debug Mode**: Single-agent analysis with network visualization
- **Performance Tracking**: Fitness charts showing evolutionary progress

### User Interaction

- Start/stop simulation
- Adjust generation time and steps
- Reset simulation
- Toggle debug mode for detailed agent inspection
- Real-time fitness and delivery tracking
